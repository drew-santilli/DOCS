				*HISTORY*
# Bash keeps a record command we have previously entered,
# We can see the actual file at ~/.bash_history

# You can scroll through the history one command at a time
#  using the up and down arrows

# We can also use the history command to view the entire history
# Though, it's generally easier to manage if we pipe the output to less.

	>`history`
	>`history | less`

******History Expansion
# use a ! with the number of the command you want from the history
	>`!1314`

******Searching History
# Ofen it's easiest to find an earlier command by searching
#  using a small portion of the command that you remember.

# Type ctrl-r to enter "reverse-i-search".
# As you are typing, bash will search the history
# and show you the best match.
# Hit ctrl-r to cycle through potential matches.
# To leave, his down-arrow
