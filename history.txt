				*HISTORY*
# Bash keeps a record command we have previously entered,
# We can see the actual file at ~/.bash_history

# You can scroll through the history one command at a time
#  using the up and down arrows

# We can also use the history command to view the entire history
# Though, it's generally easier to manage if we pipe the output to less.
