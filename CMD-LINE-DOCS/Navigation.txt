    -overview of other folders


*******ROOT
# / is the root directory in UNIX operating systems.
    -Everything is contained within root.
# The starting point for the file system is the root folder.
# We call it the root, but its actual directory name is `/`
    -Confusingly, there is a sub-directory
     named root.

                                                    `xdg-open`
                                                    -open root with GUI


                            ~ The Home Directory ~
# /home contains a home folder for each user on the system.
# For example, my home folder is located at /home/drew

 *SHORTHAND
# `/` - root
# `~` - home

                `pwd` - Print Working Directory

******ls
--------
    `ls`
    `ls -l` - Long format. It shows more information about each file/folder.
    `ls -a` - List only hidden files & folders that begin with .
                -These are not normally listed.
    `ls -la` - We can combine options!
                -This example prints detailed information for all files, including hidden files.
    

******cd
--------
# The cd command is used to change the current working directory, "moving" into another directory.
    -For example...`cd chickens` would change into chickens directory (assuming it exists.)
        -`cd /home/drew` will take you to your home directory.


        ~ Backing up with cd ~
# In Unix-like operating systems, a single dot (.) is used to represent the current directory.
# Two dots (..) represent the parent directory.
    -We can use `cd ..` to move up one level, from our current directory into the parent directory.


******Relative Paths
--------------------
# When providing paths to commands like cd or ls, we have the option of using relative or absolute paths.
# Relative paths are paths that specify a directory/file relative to the current working directory.
# For example, if our current directory is `/home/drew` and we want to cd into a directory named `animals` one          directory lower, we can simply run `cd animals`
# However, this does not work if we are located in another directory.

******Absolute Paths
# Absolute paths are paths that start from the root directory (should start with a /)
