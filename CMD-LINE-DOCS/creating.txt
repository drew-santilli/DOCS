                                        *Creating Files*

******File
# The file command can be used to determine the file type of a specified file.
    -It's honestly not that important.
# For example, running >`file contract.pdf` will tell us the file type of contract.pdf.
    -'contract.pdf: PDF document, version 1.4'
# Note: it does not use the file extension to "decide" on the file type.
    -We could have a pdf file named app.png.
