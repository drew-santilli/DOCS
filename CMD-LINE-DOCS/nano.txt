                            *Nano*
# Nano is a simple text editor that we can access right from the terminal.
# it's far more accessible than other popular command-line editors like vim and emacs.
# Nano includes all the basic text editing functionality you would expect:
            -Search, spellcheck, syntax highlighting, etc.
