			* WORKING WITH FILES *


******cat
# The cat command concatenates and prints the contents of files.
# cat <filename> will read the contents of a file and print them out.
# For example, >`cat instructions.txt` will read in from the instructions.txt
# file and then print the contents out on the screen.

	>`cat Todos/todo.txt`
# If we provide cat with multiple files,
# it will concatenate thier contents and output them.

	>`cat peanutbutter.js jelly.css`
# will output peanutbutter.js first and immediately after print jelly.css

******less
# The less command displays the contents of a file, one page at a time.
# We can navigate forwards and backwards through the file,
# which is especially useful with very large files.
	>`less somefile.txt`
	# Will display the conents of somefile.txt using less

	~ less Navigation ~
# When viewing a file using less
	- press space or f to go to the next page of the file.
	- pres b to go back to the previous page.
	- press Enter or Down arrow to scroll by one line.
	- to search, type forward slash / followed by a pattern.
	- press q to quit.

******tac
# tac (cat spelled backwards) will concatenate and print files in reverse.
# It prints each line of a file, starting with the last line.
# you can think of it as a printing in reverse "vertically"


******rev
# The rev command prints the contents of a file,
# revering the order of each line.
# Think of it as a "horizontal" reverse, whereas tac is a "vertical" reverse.



******head
# The head command prints a portion of a file, 
# starting from the beginning of a file.

# By default, it prints the first 10 lines of a file.
# >`head warAndPeace.txt` would print the first 10 lines of the
# warAndPeace.txt file.

flags: -n -c

******tail
# The tail command works similarly to the head command,
# except it prints from the END of a file.
# By default, it prints the last 10 lines of a file.

flags: -n -c -f

	~ head & tail contd ~
# We can also specify a number of lines for head to print
# using the -n option ( or --lines) followed by an integer.
	>`head -n 21 warAndPeace.txt`
# Can also :
	>`head -3 filename.txt`


******wc
# The word count command can tell us the number of words,
# lines, or bytes in files.
# By default, it prints out three numbers:
	# - the lines, words, and bytes in a file.

# We can use the -l option to limit the output to the number of lines.

# The -w option limits the output to the number of words in the file.


******sort
# The sort command outputs the sorted contents of a file
# (it does not change the file itself).
# By default, it will sort the lines of a file alphabetically.

# -r to reverse
# -n to sort by by numbers.
# -u to ignore duplicates.
	
	~ Sorting by Field ~
# We can specify a particular "column" that we want to sort by,
# using the -k option followed by a field number.
